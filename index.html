                Thank you for joining us in Crested Butte — Colorado is a place that holds a special spot in our hearts.

We're thrilled to share this beautiful moment and location with you, celebrating where our journey has brought us and where it will lead. Your presence means the world to us as we step into this new chapter together.

            <h2>Our Crested Butte Celebration</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our wedding ceremony amidst the breathtaking scenery of Crested Butte. We invite you to join us in this picturesque setting for a day of joy and festivity.</p>
            <p><em><strong>We're keeping the ceremony location and timing flexible to ensure it's perfect. While we're considering having the ceremony at the same place as the picnic, we'll make the final decision based on how the sites look the day before the wedding. We'll share the final details then, so stay tuned!</strong></em></p>
            <p><strong>10 AM (ish)- First Look:</strong> The photographer will start to take photos of Noah and Zareen at their Airbnb.</p>
            <p><strong>11 AM (ish)- Ceremony:</strong> Our wedding ceremony will commence, set against the serene environment of Crested Butte, surrounded by nature and loved ones.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-Ceremony:</strong> Join us for a delightful picnic at Oh Be Joyful Recreation Area, an informal gathering to relax and enjoy the beauty of the area while celebrating our union. The picnic will be held at the location marked on the map below.</p>

            <p>The remainder of the day will be unstructured, encouraging all to explore, relax, and play by ear. Whether you choose to wander through the natural landscapes or simply enjoy good company, we hope this day will be as memorable for you as it is for us.</p>
